## About

The **Health-Equity Dictionary** is a 22-language dictionary with terms linked to health and equity alongside their English translations for text analysis of policy documents, created and maintained by [Hannah E. Murdock](https://orcid.org/0009-0003-1207-9043) in collaboration with  [Dena Kasraian](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5253-0669), [Ahmadreza Faghih Imani](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9687-3188),  [Yurong Yu](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3292-0760),  [Audrey de Nazelle](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1092-3971),  [Dominic Stead](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8198-785X), and  [Sonja Kahlmeier](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6905-9244), for the purpose of quantitative text analysis of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) in 230 cities across 31 European countries in 22 different languages in 2023. It has three separate sub-dictionaries for more precise analysis of three overarching concepts: i) health, ii) equity, and iii) health pathways (pathways being the terms not explicitly linked to health and/or equity but rather a pathway toward health and/or equity). The results of the analysis can be found in [Kasraian et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140524001658).

### Languages available

### Dictionary creation
A custom health dictionary and a policy analysis checklist were developed in tandem in which the key issues of health and equity were identified based on the themes, keywords, and pathways based on the conceptual model of Glazener et al. (2021) and expanded by the authors, including through using existing Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) and health reviews outlined in the introduction of [Kasraian et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140524001658). The dictionary keywords were allocated into three separate sub-dictionaries for more precise analysis of three overarching concepts: i) health, ii) equity, and iii) health pathways (pathways being the terms not explicitly linked to health and/or equity but rather a pathway toward health and/or equity). The keywords were developed in English and first translated using Google Translate (Google LLC, 2023)  then validated by native speakers of all 21 non-English languages except for two (Danish and Lithuanian). We found no statistically significant difference between the Google Translate translations and native speaker translations using Wilcoxon tests for the health and equity dictionaries, while the pathways dictionary returned a statistically significant difference; therefore, use of the pathways sub-dictionary for Danish and Lithuanian may give inaccurate results. We will upload a new version of the dictionary once these languages have been validated by native speakers. More detailed background and method notes for the analysis using the dictionary can be found in the text and supplementary materials (Annex 4) of [Kasraian et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140524001658).
